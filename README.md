1. Download test data  [click this link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1yaFiD9RdBk5oFXg8UKczsVVAtkIxfwp9)
2. Open Postgresql 10 and create new database with name **gibh**
3. Extract downloaded **aena_test_data.tar.gz** file and restore recently created **gibh** database   
```
psql -h localhost -p 5434 -U postgres gmbh < /you_local_where_lacated_extractfile_path/aenaflight.sql
``` 
After restore data to **gibh** database you can see one table with name **aenaflight_2017_01**. This contains nearly 10 000 000 rows.

Colons can be used to align columns.

| Tables        | Are           | Cool  |
| ------------- |:-------------:| -----:|
| col 3 is      | right-aligned | $1600 |
| col 2 is      | centered      |   $12 |
| zebra stripes | are neat      |    $1 |
